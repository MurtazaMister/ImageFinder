- Build a web crawler that can find all images on the web page(s) that it crawls.
- Make your crawler multithreaded to speed up response times
- Be a friendly crawler and try not to hammer a site
- Can you mark images that contain people?
- Write test cases
- Global error handling

- Avoid re-crawling any pages that have already been visited.
- Crawl not only the given url, but other pages in the same domain
- Add an option to crawl only the current page OR all the subpages

- There will be svg and gif files, mostly useless, filter them
- Can you identify images as logos? Perhaps collect favicons?
- Think about how to identify different classes of images and do they need special handling
