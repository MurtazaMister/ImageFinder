- Build a web crawler that can find all images on the web page(s) that it crawls.
- Avoid re-crawling any pages that have already been visited.
- Crawl not only the given url, but other pages in the same domain
- Make your crawler multithreaded to speed up response times
- Be a friendly crawler and try not to hammer a site
- Think about how to identify different classes of images and do they need special handling
- Can you identify images as logos? Perhaps collect favicons?
- Can you mark images that contain people?
